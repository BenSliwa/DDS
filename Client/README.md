# Android-based Measurement Application


### Important Notice

The network quality indicators are obtained by low-level Android commands, which are modem-specific. **Not all devices report the same information**. For our experiments, we use a Samsung  Galaxy  S5  Neo  (Model  SM-G903F).


### Setup
- Copy all files from *src/files/* to the */sdcard/* folder of the smartphone
- In *src/app/datatransfer.cpp*, configure the *address* and *port* variables in the constructor with the corresponding values of the server application
